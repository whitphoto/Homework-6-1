First complete only the first part of the tutorial to have the camera take a default picture. 
Secondly, complete the tutorial for taking pictures (not videos). Create a page that has a button and an image 
component.  When the user clicks the button, have the camera take a picture and display the picture in the image
component.  This app should first be tested on the local machine as a desktop app.  When the app is tested in the 
emulator, default the picture to an image since the emulator does not have access to a camera.  See the notes below.
